                   <h3 class="subtitle">A European champion with Chelsea in 2012, Frank Lampard is the latest UEFA Champions League centurion in the spotlight.</h3>

                    <strong>Best performance</strong>: winner (Chelsea, 2012)<br><br>
                    
                    <h3 class="h3">If you don't remember him ...</h3><br><br>
                    When Lampard finally left Stamford Bridge in 2014, he departed as Chelsea's all-time record scorer with 211 goals – an incredible feat for a midfielder, but a deserved haul for a player who combined hard work, stamina and vision. Those qualities shone through countless times in his favourite route to goal: the late run into the area. "He's got that knack," said his uncle and former boss at West Ham, Harry Redknapp. "Every time the ball comes in the box, he'll be there running in."<br><br>
        
                    Lampard's tireless running and superb reading of the game also made him a great foil for any forward, and he racked up over 100 assists in the Premier League – many of those finished off by Didier Drogba. "Frank is the best midfield player I played with, the most intelligent and efficient," said Drogba, with Lampard now applying his intelligence and winning mentality to the manager's job at Derby County.<br><br>
                    
                    <h3 class="h3">How he made it to 100 appearances</h3><br><br>
                    The son of ex-West Ham defender Frank Lampard Sr, the talented midfielder started out at his father's old club before beginning a glittering 13-year spell with Chelsea in 2001. He made his UEFA Champions League debut in 2003/04, scoring four goals as the Blues got to the semis, and featured in the competition every season during his stay – clinching the title in 2011/12 and reaching his century against Paris Saint-Germain in the 2013/14 quarter-finals.<br><br>
                    
                   
                    <h3 class="h3">His best moments</h3><br><br>
                    Wearing the captain's armband as Chelsea beat Bayern 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw to win the 2012 UEFA Champions League final in Munich. Lampard netted in the shoot-out as the Londoners lifted the trophy for the first time at the home of their opponents.<br><br>
                    
                    Captain again as Chelsea captured the UEFA Europa League title the very next season following a 2-1 victory over Benfica in Amsterdam. Lampard helped his side into the showpiece with a trio of assists against Basel in the semi-finals.<br><br>
                    <img src="lampard.jpg" class="inlineIMG"><br><br>
                    Scoring twice against Aston Villa on 11 May 2013 to first catch Bobby Tambling as Chelsea's all-time leading goalscorer and then send himself clear in the club history books. His landmark second came after a trademark late surge into the area.<br><br>
                    
                   <h3 class="h3">What others said about him</h3> 
                    "A magnificent example of English leadership – when I see him on the field, it makes me happy."<br><br>
                    Carlo Ancelotti, former Chelsea manager
                    
                    "He was a great professional and a great example to follow. Arriving in England, I remember Didier Drogba telling me: 'Just watch Lampard, because you have to learn.' He had a hunger to score goals and to make the difference, and I've seen him score the winning goal so many times."
                    Florent Malouda, former Chelsea team-mate<br><br>
                    
                    "One of my best players ever, one of my best professionals ever; a Chelsea legend and a legend in the Premier League."
                    José Mourinho, former Chelsea manager<br><br></p>

                        <h3 class="h3">Three things to look out for this week</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Atlético and Diego Simeone are far from familiar with heavy reverses. The 4-0 humbling at Dortmund on matchday three equalled the Spanish side's worst result in the competition and was their first four-goal defeat during the Argentinian's 391 games at the helm. However, Los Colchoneros' ability to bounce back should provide cause for optimism: Real Madrid beat Atleti 3-0 twice in 2016/17, but they responded with three wins and a draw from their next four matches on each occasion, while four consecutive victories followed a 3-0 loss at Villarreal.</li><br>
                            <li>Unlike their city rivals, Real Madrid are not among the eight teams that can book their qualification with two games to spare but a win in the Czech Republic will put the holders in sight of getting past the group stage for the 22nd season running. However, the focus will just as much be on their bench, where Santiago Solari, past of their 2002 victory as a player, is expected to still be in interim charge after the dismissal of Julen Lopetegui. The last time a player from the 2002 final team took over mid-season as Madrid coach after stepping up from the reserves, Zinédine Zidane led them to the 2015/16 UEFA Champions League title, and the two after that.</li><br>
                            <li>You have to go back to October 1997 for Thierry Henry's home debut in this competition – and it was a sign of things to come that he scored twice in Monaco's 4-0 victory against Leverkusen. The Principality side will hope to draw on the experience of France's record scorer when Henry takes charge of them in Europe at the Stade Louis II for the first time 21 years later. Inspiration is certainly required as the 1-1 draw at Club Brugge on matchday three means Monaco – semi-finalists in 2016/17 – are still without a win in the section.</li> <br>

                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="h3">What's new for 2018/19?</h3>
                        This is the first season of staggered kick-off times during the UEFA Champions League group stage, with at least two games per night getting under way at 18:55CET. That's not to mention a fancy new brand identity, based on a concept called 'Highlighting moments that make the ultimate stage'. <br>
                      
                        <h3 class="h3">What's not new?</h3>
                        Thirty-two teams vying to lift the most prestigious trophy in European club football. The top two in all eight groups progress to the knockout stage, with two-legged round of 16, quarter-final and semi-final ties whittling it down to just two finalists. Talking of which ...
                        <br>
                        <h3 class="h3">When and where's the final? </h3>
                        Saturday 1 June 2019 at 21:00CET, at Atlético's home – the Estadio Metropolitano in Madrid. Stick it in your diary.<br>

                    <h3 class="h3">If you don't remember him ...</h3>
                    An Argentinian international, Solari's father Eduardo and uncle Jorge were both professionals as were his brothers, while his cousin is married to former international team-mate Fernando Redondo.<br>
                    <br>
                    Predominantly a left-sided midfielder with impressive dribbling ability and an eye for goal, Solari made waves at River Plate before heading to Europe with Atlético Madrid in 1999. Solari crossed the city following relegation a year later and would prove a reliable member of the Merengues' squad for the next five seasons, winning all 11 of his international caps during his spell in Spain.<br>
                    <br>
                    Solari's crowning moment came as part of Real Madrid's victorious 2002 UEFA Champions League side and he was involved in the move for Zidane's famous winner in the final against Leverkusen. He scooped a second Liga title the following season and racked up 209 appearances by the time he left for Inter in 2005.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="h3">What happened next</h3>
                    Success followed in Italy. Solari won Serie A in each of his three seasons at Inter, and one Coppa Italia, before finishing his career with spells at San Lorenzo, Mexico's Atlante and Uruguayan side Peñarol.<br>
                    <br>
                    After a media career, he rejoined the Merengues as Under-16 coach in 2013, and coached Real Madrid in the 2015/16 UEFA Youth League before taking over from Zidane at Castilla ahead of the 2016/17 season.<br>
                    <br>
                    His best UEFA Champions League moments
                    <ul>
                        <li>Solari was never prolific but he often saved his best for the #UCL, scoring seven of his 22 goals for Madrid in the competition.</li><br>
                        <li>His dinked finish against Lazio at the Stadio Olimpico in the 2001/02 season, en route to winning the trophy, is a goal that has lived long in the memory of the Santiago Bernabéu faithful.</li><br>
                        <li>He started the 2002 final against Bayer Leverkusen; his clipped ball down the line allowed the galloping Roberto Carlos to centre for Zidane's wonder-goal.</li><br>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
